"Keep some souvenirs of your past, or how will you ever prove it wasn't all a dream?" ~ Ashleigh Brilliant

Memorys aims to help Alzheimer patients document their fulfilled life. But how do we do it ?

Our website gives an overview of a person life in just one look! To achieve that, figures and graphical elements are preferred over raw text. For instance our timeline  summarizes succinctly one's life periods and important events.

Not only is Memorys a gift to Alzheimer patients, it also assist caregivers to respect habits and preferences. Does this resident prefers tea over coffee? Ask Memorys.

Some boring, dull description is not explicit enough for you ? We got you; follow this link to gaze at our fully immersive prototype :

Memorys is developped in academic context at HES-SO Valais/Wallis.
